## Project Background — Joe & The Juice (Retail / Product Analytics Case Study)

Joe & The Juice is a premium urban food and beverage retailer operating across high-footfall locations in major cities. The brand is known for its strong health-related product identity, fast-paced service model, and emphasis on customer experience.
As the company continues to expand its store footprint and product offering, leadership requires deeper insight into sales performance, product demand, and store-level profitability to support strategic decisions around pricing, staffing, and product portfolio optimisation.
The company has significant amounts of data on its sales, marketing efforts and operational efficiency and product offerings that has previously been underutilised. This project thoroughly analyses transactional sales data to identify key revenue drivers, growth opportunities, and operational risks across Joe & The Juice’s retail network.

Insights and recommendations are provided across four core business areas:
Revenue & Demand Trends: Understanding how sales evolve over time and identifying seasonal and behavioural patterns focusing on Revenue, Order Volume and Order Value (AOV).


Product Performance: An analysis of Joe’s various product lines, evaluating which products drive revenue versus volume and identifying underperforming items.

Store-Level Performance: Comparing store growth, stability, and revenue concentration across locations.

Profitability & Efficiency: Assessing margin dynamics and cost drivers to highlight opportunities for optimisation.
