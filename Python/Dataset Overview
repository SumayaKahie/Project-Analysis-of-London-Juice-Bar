## Dataset Overview
Products Table (products.csv)
Columns: product_id, product_name, category, size_oz, base_price_gbp, prep_time_seconds, base_cost_gbp
Base cost is calculated using a cost percentage, then cost_pct is dropped to anonymise sensitive margin info.
Stores Table (stores.csv)
Columns: store_id, store_name, weekday_revenue_min/max, weekend_revenue_min/max
Revenue ranges are synthetic and anonymised; they simulate store variability.
Transactions Table (transactions.csv)
Columns include:
transaction_id, transaction_date, hour_of_day, day_of_week, is_weekend, store_id, product_id, quantity_sold, unit_price_gbp, discount_pct, gross_sales_gbp, net_sales_gbp, cost_of_goods_gbp, gross_profit_gbp, margin_pct

Includes realistic variation:
Randomised transaction time aligned with product type (e.g., coffee → morning, juice → daytime)
Discounts randomly applied (0–15%)
Quantity selection 1–3
Price jitter ±5%

All personally identifiable data and exact revenue figures are synthetic and anonymised.

## Data Generation Logic

Define Products and Stores
Products assigned categories, sizes, prices, and prep times
Stores given anonymised daily revenue ranges (weekday/weekend)
Generate Transactions

Iterate over each date in the six-month period (Jan–Jun 2025)
For each store, determine if it's a weekend or weekday
Set daily revenue target within store ranges
Generate transactions until cumulative sales reach daily target
Pick product category based on store bias
Sample product within chosen category
Randomise quantity, price, discount, and hour of day

Calculate gross_sales, net_sales, cost_of_goods, gross_profit, and margin_pct
Build DataFrames
products_df, stores_df, transactions_df
Includes all calculated metrics for downstream analytics
Export CSV
products.csv, stores.csv, transactions.csv

##  Anonymisation Strategy

Revenue ranges are synthetic, not actual store performance
Customer-level data omitted entirely
Cost percentages are anonymised; only base_cost_gbp is exposed
Randomisation applied for:
Hour of day
Product selection within category
Quantity
Price and discount

This ensures realistic patterns while protecting sensitive business info

## Reproducibility

Change start_date and end_date for different periods
Modify store_product_bias to simulate different product preferences

Set random.seed() for fully reproducible synthetic data
CSV files can be imported into SQL databases or Power BI for analytics
